                    <p class="mb-4">Whiteloop FZE ("Whiteloop," "Muzimake," "we," "us," or "our") provides services to you subject to these Terms of Use ("Terms"). These Terms are a binding agreement between you and Whiteloop governing your use of our website (e.g., www.muzimake.com) and any profiles, pages, or apps we control (collectively, the "Website") and our related products and services (the "Services").</p>
                    <p class="mb-4">By accessing or using the Website or Services, you agree to these Terms and to our Privacy Policy (incorporated by reference). If you do not agree, do not use the Website or Services.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4">We may update these Terms from time to time. Changes are effective upon posting. Your continued use after changes means you accept the updated Terms.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h2 class="font-bold text-lg mb-4">2) Website Access & Eligibility</h2>
                    <p class="mb-4">We grant you a limited, revocable, non-transferable permission to use the Website for personal, non-commercial use, provided that you (i) do not copy, distribute, or modify any part of the Website without our prior written consent; (ii) use the Website only for its intended purpose; and (iii) comply with these Terms and all applicable laws.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4">You represent that you are of legal age to form a binding contract in your jurisdiction and are not barred from using the Services. You agree to provide accurate, current, and complete information and to keep it updated. We may suspend or terminate access if we suspect inaccurate information or a violation of these Terms.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4">No automated access: you may not use robots, spiders, scrapers, or similar tools to send more requests than a human reasonably could using a standard browser. Public search engines may index for public search only (no caches/archives); we can revoke this at any time.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4">No harvesting of personal data or use of our communication tools for commercial solicitation.</p>

                    <h2 class="font-bold text-lg mb-4">3) Third-Party Links</h2>
                    <p class="mb-4">The Website may contain links to third-party sites and services. We are not responsible for their content, policies, or practices. Your use of third-party resources is at your own risk.</p>

                    <h2 class="font-bold text-lg mb-4">4) Payments, Pricing, Refunds, Revisions, Gift Cards & Referrals</h2>
                    <p class="mb-4"><strong>Fees & Currency.</strong> Prices for Muzimake products (e.g., custom songs) are shown at checkout and are generally settled in AED (or as displayed). Typical base price: AED 35 per custom song. Your bank/payment provider may charge currency conversion or other fees.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4"><strong>Payment Methods.</strong> You authorize us and our payment processors to charge your selected method (e.g., card, Apple Pay, Google Pay) for purchases, including taxes/fees as applicable. Your use of a payment method is governed by your agreement with that provider.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4"><strong>Order Flow & Delivery.</strong> After you submit your brief/story and complete payment, production begins. Delivery is typically via download link and/or Email/WhatsApp (as shown at checkout). Any stated delivery estimates (often under 6 hours, workload permitting) are targets, not guarantees.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4"><strong>Inclusions.</strong> Unless otherwise stated at purchase, each order includes two (2) song variations (e.g., alternate take/arrangement) and up to two (2) reasonable revision rounds focused on lyrics, vibe, or mix tweaks aligned with your original brief. Substantially new directions may require an additional fee.</p>
                    
                    <p class="mb-4"><strong>Cancellations & Refunds.</strong></p>
                    <ul class="mb-4">
                        <li>Once production has started, orders are generally non-cancelable and non-refundable.</li>
                        <li>If we cannot fulfill your order (e.g., unexpected technical failure), we will issue either a full refund or account credit (your choice).</li>
                        <li>If we request required information and you do not provide it within a reasonable time, we may cancel and refund minus applicable service/processing fees or issue account credit.</li>
                        <li>Certain instant/express products may be non-refundable as noted at purchase.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p class="mb-4"><strong>Gift Cards / Credits.</strong> If offered, Muzimake gift cards/credits may be used only on the Website, are not redeemable for cash, are non-transferable, and may be subject to additional terms shown at purchase. We are not responsible for lost/undeliverable digital gift cards due to inaccurate recipient details.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4"><strong>Referral Program.</strong> If offered, referral credits are for personal sharing with your own contacts. Credits may be issued to you and referred first-time customers when they purchase, per the then-current program terms. We may withhold/revoke/cancel credits for suspected abuse, fraud, or violations.</p>

                    <p class="mb-4">All content on the Website and in the Services—including text, artwork, graphics, UI, recordings, arrangements, compositions, and logos (collectively, "Content")—is owned by or licensed to Whiteloop and protected by applicable IP laws.

                    <p class="mb-4"><strong>Your Custom Song (Master & Composition).</strong><br>
                    When you purchase a custom song from Muzimake, you receive a personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable license to download, store, and privately use the delivered master audio recording and embedded musical composition (together, the "Song") for personal purposes (e.g., sharing with friends/family, posting to your personal social profiles). Unless we grant you additional written rights, you may not:</p>
                    <ul class="mb-4">
                        <li>commercially exploit, sell, license, distribute, monetize, or collect royalties on the Song;</li>
                        <li>register the Song or composition with any rights organization/platform as your own;</li>
                        <li>use the Song in paid advertising, brand campaigns, or broadcast without a separate written license.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p class="mb-4">We may provide simple sharing mechanisms (e.g., a link or embed). Those do not transfer any ownership and may be revoked.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4"><strong>Muzimake's Use of Snippets.</strong><br>
                    We may (at reasonable discretion) use short excerpts ("snippets") of Songs for portfolio/product demos/marketing without disclosing private or sensitive details. You may request removal by contacting us.</p>
